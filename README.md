### <b> ShelfSight - Product Detection </b>

ShelfSight is a production-focused computer vision project designed to simulate a real-world retail shelf monitoring system.

The goal is to transform shelf images into structured, queryable data that can support inventory monitoring and operational decision-making.

#### <b> Objectives </b>
```bash
* Expose a FastAPI-based inference service

* Process images individually and in batch mode

* Persist structured results to PostgreSQL

* Integrate with AWS S3 for input and output storage

* Support containerized execution via Docker and docker-compose

* Demonstrate deployment readiness for Amazon EC2

* Include event-driven processing via AWS Lambda + Serverless

* Maintain test coverage using Pytest
```
